# pingai
this is an attempt to do ai and auto generate nn based on locational closeness to one another rather then hand made nns and hidden layers.  Through activation a ping will be sent out that will then help strengthen a network

this was going to be written in python but its litterally the worst freaking language ever. Also native event support is a huge perk with js so i switched to it. Although this would probably be pretty nice in c or java too.
